**Workbench** is the default client for [QUIS](https://github.com/javadch/quis). It has an IDE-like workbench and a command line interface to interact with the engine. Users are able to create projects, author processing scripts and run them against various data sources. The result sets are shown in the form of tables, graphs, or files.

The IDE uses the [JideSoft's](http://www.jidesoft.com/) UI framework and components.
