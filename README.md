**SciQuest** is an IDE-like workbench and a command line interface for the [XQt](https://github.com/javadch/XQt) language. Users are able to create processing projects, add and author process scripts and run them against various data sources. The result sets are then shown in forms of tables, graphs and so on based on the query statements.

The IDE uses the [JideSoft's](http://www.jidesoft.com/) UI framework and components.

**Note**: It is in the early steps of its road-map, so not production ready!
